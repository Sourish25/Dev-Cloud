## 🎯 Chosen Problem Statement

> **Problem Statement 3: SkillMatch — Micro Job & Collaboration Platform**.
>
> This problem involves building a simple web system where users can post short projects or skills they need help with, and other users can connect to assist.

## 💡 Our Solution

Our project, **Dev Cloud**, directly solves the chosen problem statement by creating a centralized marketplace for skills and short-term project help.

* **How it solves the problem:** It provides the essential "Expected Outcomes" by allowing users to **post and search skill listings**. It bridges the gap between those needing help and those offering it with a simple **"Connect" button**, facilitating direct communication.
* **Impact:** This system directly **encourages collaboration and peer learning**. Instead of skills remaining siloed, students, freelancers, and other collaborators (the "Relevant Stakeholders") can easily find each other to solve problems, learn new things, and complete projects more efficiently.
