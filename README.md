## 🎯 Chosen Problem Statement

> **Problem Statement 3: SkillMatch — Micro Job & Collaboration Platform**.
>
> This problem involves building a simple web system where users can post short projects or skills they need help with, and other users can connect to assist.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Our project, **Dev Cloud**, directly solves the chosen problem statement by creating a centralized marketplace for skills and short-term project help.

* **How it solves the problem:** It provides the essential "Expected Outcomes" by allowing users to **post and search skill listings**. It bridges the gap between those needing help and those offering it with a simple **"Connect" button**, facilitating direct communication.
* **Impact:** This system directly **encourages collaboration and peer learning**. Instead of skills remaining siloed, students, freelancers, and other collaborators (the "Relevant Stakeholders") can easily find each other to solve problems, learn new things, and complete projects more efficiently.

## ✨ Core Features

* **Project Detail Pages:** Users can click on any project to see a detailed description, project goals, required skills, and budget.
* **Post a Request:** A dedicated form page (`post.html`) for users to submit their own projects.
* **User Profiles:** A `profile.html` page to display user information, collaboration history, and ratings.
* **Connect & Message:** A "Send Request" button on project pages that links to the messaging system (`messages.html`).
* **Light/Dark Mode:** A theme toggle button in the navbar for user preference.
